# Other Information
This project had a time limit of 12 days, and was a group effort involved 5 people. Machine learning model code and app development were mostly completed by other team members, with my role centered around the business and content creation behind Cleansea. However, all members have an understanding of machine learning algorithms and were involved in theorizing, overseeing, and checking work. <br>
